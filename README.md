## OSGeo: Best GCI Experience.
![img.png]({{site.baseurl}}/image.png)
### What is GCI?
GCI(Google Code-in) is an annual programming competition hosted by Google LLC that allows pre-university students to complete tasks specified by various, partnering open source organizations.
### What is OSGeo?
The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, is a non-profit non-governmental organization whose mission is to support and promote the collaborative development of open geospatial technologies and data.
### Journey
So, my journey begin from 3.12.19 . As, It was my first time, participating in GCI. I was a bit nervous about completing the tasks and also about choosing the Organisation which suits me best. So, after a bit of researching, I choose OSGeo as my Organisation, and I can easily say that I am very happy with my decision. First of all, I started by doing a beginner task and it was pretty easy. Then I gradually started working on the tasks and gained an interest in them. Then I continued doing some tasks related to OpenLayers and Coding.
It was great fun doing the Challenging task, I choose many coding Task Such as:-
* Grass Gis Unit Testing
* Openlayers GeoforAll
* Geoserver WMS & CQL
* istSOS Compile Source code & Visualize the data
and many more. I also contributed to pgRouting, GeoNode and Geoserver.
* I have also done a variety of task related to Design, Research, Documentation and Quality Assurance as well.

### Interesting & Funny Momments
* Well The most Interesting part happen when Me and Lucifier([Shivam](https://github.com/ShivamRai2003)) were on a discussion on pgRouting with [cvvergara](https://github.com/cvvergara) , and she gave both of us a task on team work, she also congratulated both of us after the approval of the task. It was a great fun working on the task. It was one of the most peculiar task in GCI.
* There was one more occasion when me and other participant was set up in a discussion, it was a small comedy though while discussing, but it was a great conversation among us.

### Best Momments
* Completing all GrassGis Unit Testing task was one of the best momments as it took me a lot of time to do them.
* Helping students and recieving "thanks" message from them was a great momment, I was pretty happy that I helped them.
* The Best momment was When I got appriciation from mentors including [Rahul Chauhan](https://github.com/rahulworld) , [Victoria](https://github.com/vrautenbach) , [Cameron](https://github.com/CamGreen) , [Vicky Vergara](https://github.com/cvvergara) .

### Mentors
I choosed OSGeo as my Organisation, I am very glad that, though I am not so good in taking decision, but choosing OSGeo as the Organisation was one of my best decision that I had ever taken. OSGeo is a great and one of the oldest and Sucessful GCI organisation.
This was not possible without the mentors.
The mentors were very kind and generous to me and whenever I get stuck in any problem than they always supported and guided me. That's why I never abondoned any of my task, I was always hoping that my mentors will guide me and my hopes were always fulfilled.

**Who is the best Mentor?**

It is really hard for me to answer this question, all the mentors were best. But than also if I have to choose some of the specific one's so here is there list
* [Victoria](https://github.com/vrautenbach)
* [Vicky Vergara](https://github.com/cvvergara)
* [Rahul Chauhan](https://github.com/rahulworld)
* [Cameron](https://github.com/CamGreen)
* [Sunveer Singh](https://github.com/SunveerSingh)
* [Om Shinde](https://github.com/omshinde)
* [Abhinav Kumar](https://github.com/Abby3017)

They all helped me a lot, and Thanks! once Again to all of you.

### Learnings
* Participating in Google Codein is one of best decisons of my life. I not only get introduced to the world of Open Source Development but also taught me how it feels working with a team, which was really a great fun interesting
* I have a keen interest in Coding , Mapping, Geography and specially in the cartography and this event has made me learnt a lot about OSGeo, which is an  Open Source Geospatial Foundation, with a lots of projects related to the above topics. 
* I also learned about some OSGeo projects such as:-
  * istSOS
  * Grass Gis
  * GDAL
  * Geonode
  * Geonetwork
  * Geoserver
  * GeoforAll
* One more thing which I learned is patience. I have learned to keep patience.

### Final Thoughts & Further Plan
* So, my final thoughts about GCI & OSGeo is "Fantastic".
* **Google Code in**
  * First of all I want to thanks Google to launch this platform. It is a great platform for learning and testing the skills.
  * Also, it is also a great way of introducing students to the world of Open Source Development.
  * And about the future plan, I have decided that I will stay with Google Code in for a long time, if not as a participant, than as a "mentor"(If I get a Chance)
* **OSGeo**
  * If you are searching for the organisation with a really nice mentor staff, nice support and as well as related to GeoSpatial, then I will surely recommand "OSGeo".
  * And about the future plans with OSGeo, I surely want to contribute to OSGeo as much as I could and will try to contribute to it's projects other than that which are in the task, It's most recent example is "pgRouting Workshop" where I contributed, by Updating some files.

### Suggestion & queries
* I have only one query which is somewhat related to Plagiarism:-
  * That In the competition one can easily take the help of their parents or his/her parentscould easily solve the task ?
* I have the suggestion for the following query:-
  * In every task the participant should be asked to submit a video, with the facecam(either upload it to youtube or send the mp4 file) explaining the work he/she has done or submitted.This would probably solve the problem, as whose parents have solved the task won't be able to give the explaination and would be caught.
